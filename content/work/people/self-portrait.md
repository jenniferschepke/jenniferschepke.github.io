### Why did I paint myself?
On a sunny day, my friend took a photo of me in a prayer chapel with stained glass windows. I decided to use that photo as a reference for this painting due to the unique lighting.

#### Created with:

1. Photoshop (digitally hand-painted)
2. My friend's reference photo :)
