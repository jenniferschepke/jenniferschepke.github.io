# Hello, my name is Jennifer
***It's nice to meet you!***

- I am an artist and illustrator based in Detroit, Michigan.

- I graduated from Indiana Wesleyan University with a BS in Graphic Design and Illustration.

- I enjoy working mainly with gouache, acrylic, and colored pencils.

##### Most of my work is inspired by small moments:

- The first sip of coffee in the morning

- Laughing without fear

- Watching the sunset with someone you love

I believe that God created a world with abundant beauty. My goal is to create art that depicts the beauty and joy of life, no matter the circumstance.

###### *"Beauty is truth. The truer something is the more beautiful it is. The most beautiful things were made by God." Tucker Carlson*
